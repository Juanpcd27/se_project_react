My project is named WTWR, This is the frontend from the full stack project.

* I created a website that allows the user to have a recommendation on which clothing items they should use depending on the weather from the users city and from the inputs they submit.

* There are multiple forms in this project, there is a form to register and another one to log in, and also a form to create the clothing item, choose the desired weather where the page will recommend a clothing item to display as the card, showing if its for cold, warm or hot weather.
  
* The clothing item will be presented to the user in cards, displaying the desired picture, and when to wear it depending on the weather.

* The user has a slider button that allows the temperature to change from F° to C° depending on the users preferences.

* The user can register and log in, if logged in, the user can navigate to a different section that will display the users name and desired profile picture.
  
* The user can click the image on the card to preview the image in a larger size.

* The user can like and dislike the cards.

* The user can delete the cards.

* This project is designed in a responsive way, meaning it can be accessed in any resolution.
